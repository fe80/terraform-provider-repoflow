# Repoflow Terraform Provider

Manage your [Repoflow](https://www.repoflow.com/) with terraform.

This provider utilizes the stable api (v1) to interact with Repoflow.

## Setup

### Authentication

```terraform
provider "repoflow" {
  base_url = "https://repoflow.example/api"
  api_key  = "pat_xxx"
}
```

It's best practice not to store the authentication token in plain text. As an alternative, the provider can source the authentication token from the `REPOFLOW_API_KEY` environment variable. It's also possible to use `REPOFLOW_BASE_URL` to define the base url (default is `https://127.0.0.1/api`).
