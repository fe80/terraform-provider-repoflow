# Repoflow Terraform Provider

Manage your [RepoFlow](https://www.repoflow.io/) with Terraform.

This provider interacts with RepoFlow using the stable API (v1).

## Setup

### Authentication

```terraform
provider "repoflow" {
  base_url = "https://repoflow.example/api"
  api_key  = "pat_xxx"
}
```

To adhere to security best practices, do not store authentication tokens in plaintext. As an alternative, the provider can retrieve the token from the `REPOFLOW_API_KEY` environment variable. Additionally, the `REPOFLOW_BASE_URL` variable may be used to define a custom Base URL (the default is `https://127.0.0.1/api`).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "repoflow" {
  base_url = "https://repoflow.example/api"
  api_key  = "pat_xxx"
}
```
